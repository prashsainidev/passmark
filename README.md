# Passmark

Passmark is an open-source AI framework for regression testing. Most AI testing tools focus on testing a single PR. Passmark is designed for continuous regression testing of applications, where the goal is to catch regressions as soon as they occur, without needing to update AI prompts or retrain models.

Passmark uses AI models to execute natural language steps via Playwright, with intelligent caching, auto-healing, and multi-model assertion verification.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm init playwright@latest passmark-project # select the default options and set language to TypeScript
cd passmark-project
npm install passmark
```

We need at least one model from Anthropic and one from Google to use Passmark's multi-model consensus features. Set the required environment variables in `.env`:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=AIza...
```

Alternatively, you can use an AI gateway like Vercel AI Gateway to route requests to multiple providers without managing individual API keys. If you choose this option, set `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` instead. Note: we support only Vercel AI Gateway at the moment, but we're planning to add support for other gateways in the future.

Set your Playwright project to read `.env` by adding the following to `playwright.config.ts`  (after `import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';`):

```typescript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import path from 'path';

dotenv.config({ path: path.resolve(__dirname, '.env') });
```

Make sure you install `dotenv` by running `npm install dotenv`.

Now, paste the following code into `tests/example.spec.ts`:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";
import { runSteps } from "passmark";

test.use({
  headless: !!process.env.CI,
});

test("Shopping cart tests", async ({ page }) => {
  test.setTimeout(60_000); // increase timeout for AI execution
  await runSteps({
    page,
    userFlow: "Add product to cart",
    steps: [
      { description: "Navigate to https://demo.vercel.store" },
      { description: "Click Acme Circles T-Shirt" },
      { description: "Select color", data: { value: "White" } },
      { description: "Select size", data: { value: "S" } },
      { description: "Add to cart", waitUntil: "My Cart is visible" },
    ],
    assertions: [{ assertion: "You can see My Cart with Acme Circles T-Shirt" }],
    test,
    expect
  });
});
```

If you are using Vercel AI Gateway, you can add the following to the above code:

```typescript
import { runSteps, configure } from "passmark";

configure({
  ai: {
    gateway: "vercel" // Make sure to set AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY in your .env file
  }
});
```

To run the test, use:

```bash
npx playwright test example.spec.ts --project chromium
```

After the test completes, you can run `npx playwright show-report` to see a detailed report of the test execution, including an AI summary at the top, provided by Passmark.

## Core Functions

### `runSteps(options: RunStepsOptions)`

Executes a sequence of steps using AI with caching. Each step is described in natural language and executed via Playwright.

```typescript
await runSteps({
  page,
  userFlow: "Checkout Flow",
  steps: [
    { description: "Add item to cart" },
    { description: "Go to checkout" },
    { description: "Fill in shipping details", data: { value: "123 Main St" } },
  ],
  assertions: [{ assertion: "Order confirmation is displayed" }],
  test,
  expect,
});
```

### `runUserFlow(options: UserFlowOptions)`

Runs a complete user flow as a single AI agent call. Best for exploratory testing where exact steps are flexible.

```typescript
const result = await runUserFlow({
  page,
  userFlow: "Complete a purchase",
  steps: "Navigate to store, add an item, checkout with test card",
  effort: "high", // by default "low" uses gemini-3-flash for faster execution; "high" uses gemini-3.1-pro-preview for deeper thinking
});
```

### `assert(options: AssertionOptions)`

Multi-model consensus assertion. Runs Claude and Gemini in parallel; if they disagree, a third model arbitrates.

```typescript
const result = await assert({
  page,
  assertion: "The dashboard shows 3 active projects",
  expect,
});
```

## Configuration

Call `configure()` once before using any functions:

```typescript
import { configure } from "passmark";

configure({
  ai: {
    gateway: "none", // "none" (default) or "vercel"
    models: {
      stepExecution: "google/gemini-3-flash",
      utility: "google/gemini-2.5-flash",
    },
  },
  uploadBasePath: "./uploads",
});
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `REDIS_URL` | No | - | Redis connection URL for step caching and global state |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes | - | Anthropic API key for Claude models |
| `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` | Yes | - | Google API key for Gemini models |
| `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` | If gateway=vercel | - | Vercel AI Gateway API key |
| `AXIOM_TOKEN` | No | - | Axiom token for OpenTelemetry tracing |
| `AXIOM_DATASET` | No | - | Axiom dataset for trace storage |
| `PASSMARK_LOG_LEVEL` | No | `info` | Log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `silent` |

## Model Configuration

All models are configurable via `configure({ ai: { models: { ... } } })`:

| Key | Default | Used For |
|-----|---------|----------|
| `stepExecution` | `google/gemini-3-flash` | Executing individual steps |
| `userFlowLow` | `google/gemini-3-flash-preview` | User flow execution (low effort) |
| `userFlowHigh` | `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | User flow execution (high effort) |
| `assertionPrimary` | `anthropic/claude-4.5-haiku` | Primary assertion model (Claude) |
| `assertionSecondary` | `google/gemini-3-flash` | Secondary assertion model (Gemini) |
| `assertionArbiter` | `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | Arbiter for assertion disagreements |
| `utility` | `google/gemini-2.5-flash` | Data extraction, wait conditions |

## Caching

Passmark caches successful step actions in Redis. On subsequent runs, cached steps execute directly without AI calls, dramatically reducing latency and cost.

- Steps are cached by `userFlow` + `step.description`
- Set `bypassCache: true` on individual steps or the entire run to force AI execution
- Cache is automatically bypassed on Playwright retries
- Caching only applies to `runSteps`. As of now, only those AI executions that are single-step are cached as multi-step actions can vary widely and are less likely to be identical on subsequent runs. We're exploring ways to safely cache multi-step flows.

## Telemetry

Telemetry is opt-in. Set `AXIOM_TOKEN` and `AXIOM_DATASET` to enable OpenTelemetry tracing via Axiom. All AI calls are wrapped with `withSpan` for observability.

Without these env vars, telemetry is a no-op.

Configure Axiom to get a rich dashboard like this:

## Email Extraction

Configure an email provider for testing flows that involve email verification. By default, you can use the `emailsink` provider, which provides disposable email addresses and an API to fetch received emails. The free tier doesn't need any credentials, but for more reliability and flexible rate limits, you can sign up for an account and use your `EMAILSINK_API_KEY`. Reach out to us if you want to get an API key.

```typescript
import { configure } from "passmark";
import { emailsinkProvider } from "passmark/providers/emailsink";

configure({
  email: emailsinkProvider({ apiKey: process.env.EMAILSINK_API_KEY }),
});
```

Or implement a custom provider:

```typescript
configure({
  email: {
    domain: "my-test-mail.com",
    extractContent: async ({ email, prompt }) => {
      // Fetch and extract content from your email service
      return extractedValue;
    },
  },
});
```

Use in steps with the `{{email.*}}` placeholder pattern:

```typescript
{
  description: "Enter the verification code",
  data: { value: "{{email.otp:get the 6 digit verification code:{{run.dynamicEmail}}}}" }
}
```

## Placeholder System

Dynamic values can be injected into step data using placeholders:

| Pattern | Scope | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `{{run.email}}` | Single test | Random email (faker) |
| `{{run.dynamicEmail}}` | Single test | Email using configured domain |
| `{{run.fullName}}` | Single test | Random full name |
| `{{run.shortid}}` | Single test | Short unique ID |
| `{{run.phoneNumber}}` | Single test | Random phone number |
| `{{global.email}}` | All tests in an execution | Shared across runSteps calls with same `executionId` |
| `{{global.dynamicEmail}}` | All tests in an execution | Shared dynamic email |
| `{{data.key}}` | Per project | Stored in Redis, managed via project settings |
| `{{email.type:prompt}}` | Resolved lazily | Extract content from received email |
